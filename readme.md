notes
==========================


General
----------
    font and font size not exactly the same as the ones in the example image

    Font Awesome Icons in example are outlined. I could not find all the outlined icons used in the example, used the solid icons, so they all matched for a consistent styling. (found the problem, was using an older version of FA CDN link)


Side Nav
-----------
    Divider Line and Customize button need to be moved to the bottom of Side Nav


Reports Section
------------------
    Height of Report Divs need to be reduced to match example


Charts Section
-----------------

    Orders Chart
    ---------------
        Bars need a radius (round ends)

        Fix Y-axis Legend (ie: $0k, $10k, $20K,...) 
        




Responsiveness
-----------------
    Looks good on all screen sizes, however.. . 

    Customize button floats behind divs on screen size 576px - 1199px

    hide Side Nav and contents, display hamburger at 1199px and less
