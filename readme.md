notes
==========================


General
----------
    font and font size not exactly the same as the ones in the example image

    Font Awesome Icons in example are outlined. I could not all the outlined icons used in the example, used the solid icons, so they all matched for a consistent styling.



Side Nav
-----------
    Menu list arrows point down when sub list is show.
    ( I like it, it's more intuitive, but does not match example )

    Divider Line and Customize button need to be moved to the bottom of Side Nav

    Customize button FA icon different from exampe.


Reports Section
------------------
    Budget FA icon not displaying

    Height of Report Divs need to be reduced to match example


Charts Section
-----------------
    Replace Header shadow to Divider line to match example

    Orders Chart
    ---------------
        Bars need a radius (round ends)

        Remove vertical gridlines

        Horizontal gridlines should be dotted

        Fix Y-axis Legend (ie: $0k, $10k, $20K,...) 




Responsiveness
-----------------
    Looks good on all screen sizes. 

    Customize button floats behind divs on screen size 576px - 1199px
